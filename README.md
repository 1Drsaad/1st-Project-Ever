This is my first project ever (2020) cls  In 2020, when everyone was quarantined, I was working out in my room, lifting some dumbbells and doing some pushups and pullups. However, I was struggling to track my reps. I looked in the Google Play Store for a rep tracker, but all I found was too advanced and complicated to use. All I wanted was an easy one-page app that works almost like a calculator, asking you for a number and storing it as a score, so you can start adding new values to that score.  Then, I started thinking about whether I could do something like this on my own and how to begin. I decided to start looking, searching, and asking my cousin (he is also a dev, there was no ChatGPT back then, LOL). After a little while, I found out that I could make it using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. So, this was my first real searching and "coding," but not the first time trying to code because I had an earlier experience with HTML and CSS in 2017, something very basic like "hello world" and some font-size, font-family... Then I stopped because I was in high school and had no idea why I should learn dev; I just saw my cousin coding and I liked it.  This is the story of my first project ever!
